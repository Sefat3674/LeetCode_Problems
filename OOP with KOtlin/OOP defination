1. What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects, which are instances of classes. OOP helps organize code in a modular, reusable, and maintainable way.

Key principles of OOP:

Encapsulation – Keep data safe inside objects.

Abstraction – Hide implementation details and expose only functionality.

Inheritance – Reuse code from other classes.

Polymorphism – One interface, multiple implementations.
